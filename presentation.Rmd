## Assignment

- Pitch my Shiny App
- Built with R version `r getRversion()`
- The Shiny App helps you predict the airquality in New York
      - Uses Temperature in Fahrenheit as user input
      - Output is air quality in ppb

## Dataset "airquality" Summary

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```

## Plot of "airquality" variables

```{r}
plot(airquality)
```

## Linear Model and Plot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = airquality)
plot(x = airquality$Temp, y = airquality$Ozone, main = "Air Quality in New 
     York for Given Temperature")
abline(model, col = "red")
```
